# Task for the first Pair Assignment
Each pair will create a new public GitHub repository. It must be fully documented, 
including with a descriptive README.md file. Your code must be human readable and 
clearly commented.

Each pair should include R source code files that:
+ Access at least two core R data sets
+ Illustrate the datas’ distributions using a variety of relevant
descriptive statistics
+ Two files must be dynamically linked

Another pair makes a pull request. And this is discussed/merged.
