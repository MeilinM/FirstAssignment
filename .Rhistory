### Descriptive Statistics
### Given that the data set looks at gives the average heights and weights
### for American women aged 30???39, it is worth looking at the following
### descriptive statistics: mean, mode, medium, variance and standard deviation.
### The frequency is not providing useful information and the histogram is thus
### not very relevant.
# 1. Plot variables to observe potential links
plot(women$height,women$weight)
# 2. Mean
mean (women$height)
mean (women$weight)
# 3. Median
median(women$height)
median(women$weight)
# 4. Mode (check)
# 5. Range
range(women$height)
range(women$weight)
# 6. Variance
var(women$height)
var(women$weight)
# 7. Standard deviation
sd(women$height)
sd(women$weight)
# 8. Quartiles
